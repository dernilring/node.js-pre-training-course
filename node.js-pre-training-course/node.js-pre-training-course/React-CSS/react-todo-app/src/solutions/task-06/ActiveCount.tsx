/**
 * Task 6: ActiveCount Component
 *
 * Theory: Props and Component Communication
 *
 * Props are the primary way components communicate in React. They allow parent components to pass
 * data down to child components. Props are read-only and should never be modified by the receiving component.
 *
 * Props Best Practices:
 * 1. Keep props simple and focused
 * 2. Use TypeScript interfaces to define prop types
 * 3. Provide default values when appropriate
 * 4. Destructure props for cleaner code
 * 5. Use meaningful prop names
 *
 * Component Communication Patterns:
 *
 * Parent to Child (Props):
 * - Parent passes data to child via props
 * - Child receives and displays data
 * - Example: <TodoList todos={todos} />
 *
 * Child to Parent (Callback Props):
 * - Parent passes function as prop
 * - Child calls function to communicate back
 * - Example: <TodoItem onComplete={handleComplete} />
 *
 * Sibling Communication:
 * - Both siblings receive data from common parent
 * - Parent manages shared state
 * - Example: TodoList and ActiveCount both use todos from parent
 *
 * Data Flow Principles:
 * - Data flows down (parent to child)
 * - Events flow up (child to parent)
 * - Keep data as close to where it's used as possible
 * - Lift state up when multiple components need the same data
 *
 * Key Concepts:
 * - Props are immutable
 * - Components should be pure functions of their props
 * - Use TypeScript for better prop validation
 * - Consider prop drilling vs context for deep data passing

export const ActiveCount: React.FC<ActiveCountProps> = ({ todos }) => {
  // TODO: Implement the ActiveCount component
  //
  // Requirements:
  // 1. Calculate the number of active (incomplete) todos
  // 2. Display the count in a user-friendly format
  // 3. Handle edge cases (empty array, all completed)
  // 4. Make the component reusable for any todos array
  //
  // Example implementation:
  if (!todos || todos.length === 0) {
    return <h2>todos are empty or don't exist</h2>;
  }
  const activeCount = todos.filter((todo) => !todo.completed).length;

  return (
    <div>
      <span> {activeCount} active todo(s)</span>
    </div>
  );
};
