 Description:
 Implemented full CRUD operations for the todos entity using Prisma ORM in NestJS:
 
 CREATE: POST endpoint creates new todos with title, description, and completed status
 READ: GET endpoints retrieve all todos or filter by completion status, also GET by ID
 UPDATE: PUT endpoint updates todo fields (title, description, status) by ID
 DELETE: DELETE endpoint removes todos by ID

 Issues encountered:
 1. Field mapping: Database uses 'status' field but API expects 'completed' boolean
    Solution: Created mapToApiFormat() method to convert between DB and API formats
 2. Update method initially threw 404 for all requests due to incorrect error handling
    Solution: Removed generic try-catch and let Prisma errors propagate correctly
 3. Description field not appearing in API responses
    Solution: Added description field to mapToApiFormat() return object

 All operations tested successfully using Thunder Client extension in VS Code.
