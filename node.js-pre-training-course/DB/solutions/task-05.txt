COUNT AGGREGATION: Count todos by status

Count active todos
SELECT COUNT(t.status)
FROM todos t 
WHERE t.status = 'active'
GROUP BY t.status;

Count completed todos
SELECT COUNT(t.status)
FROM todos t 
WHERE t.status = 'completed'
GROUP BY t.status;


INNER JOIN: Count todos per user

Select user names with their todo counts
SELECT u.name, COUNT(u.id) as count_todos
FROM users u 
INNER JOIN todos t ON u.id = t.user_id
GROUP BY u.id;


EXCEPT OPERATION: Find users without todos

Select users who have no associated todos
SELECT u.name
FROM users u
EXCEPT
SELECT u.name 
FROM users u 
INNER JOIN todos t ON u.id = t.user_id
GROUP BY u.id;

Alternative query using LEFT JOIN:
SELECT u.name
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN todos t ON u.id = t.user_id
WHERE t.id IS NULL;


DESCRIPTION OF WORK

WHAT I DID:
1. Used COUNT() aggregate function to calculate number of todos by status
2. Applied WHERE clause to filter todos by specific status (active or completed)
3. Used GROUP BY to group results by status category
4. Implemented INNER JOIN to combine users and todos tables
5. Counted todos for each user using COUNT() with GROUP BY user id
6. Used EXCEPT set operation to find users without any todos


QUERY EXPLANATIONS:

COUNT() Function:
Aggregate function that counts number of rows matching criteria
Combined with WHERE clause to filter specific status values
GROUP BY organizes results into groups for counting

INNER JOIN:
Combines rows from users and todos tables where u.id matches t.user_id
Only returns users who have at least one todo
Foreign key relationship ensures data integrity between tables

GROUP BY Clause:
Groups rows with same values in specified column(s)
Required when using aggregate functions like COUNT() with non-aggregated columns
In this case, groups by u.id to count todos per user

EXCEPT Operator:
Set operation that returns rows from first query not present in second query
Finds users who exist in users table but have no matching todos
Alternative to LEFT JOIN with NULL check
