COUNT AGGREGATION: Count todos by status

Count active todos
SELECT COUNT(t.status)
FROM todos t 
WHERE t.status = 'active'
GROUP BY t.status;

Count completed todos
SELECT COUNT(t.status)
FROM todos t 
WHERE t.status = 'completed'
GROUP BY t.status;


INNER JOIN: Count todos per user

Select user names with their todo counts
SELECT u.name, COUNT(u.id) as count_todos
FROM users u 
INNER JOIN todos t ON u.id = t.user_id
GROUP BY u.id;


EXCEPT OPERATION: Find users with no todos

Select users who have no associated todos
SELECT u.name
FROM users u
EXCEPT
SELECT u.name 
FROM users u 
INNER JOIN todos t ON u.id = t.user_id
GROUP BY u.id;

Alternative query using LEFT JOIN:
SELECT u.name
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN todos t ON u.id = t.user_id
WHERE t.id IS NULL;

DESCRIPTION OF WORK              

WHAT I DID:
1. Used COUNT() aggregate function to calculate number of todos by status
2. Applied WHERE clause to filter todos by specific status (active or completed)
3. Used GROUP BY to group results by status category
4. Implemented INNER JOIN to combine users and todos tables
5. Counted todos for each user using COUNT() with GROUP BY user id
6. Used EXCEPT set operation to find users without any
