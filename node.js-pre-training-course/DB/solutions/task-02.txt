SQL QUERIES EXECUTED:
                        

INSERT: Add new todos to the database

INSERT INTO todos (title, description, status, user_id)
VALUES ('buy milk', 'buy milk for pancackes (3.2%)', 'completed', 1);

INSERT INTO todos (title, description, status, user_id)
VALUES ('prepare christmas presents', NULL, 'not completed', 2);



SELECT: Read and display all todos from the table

SELECT * FROM todos t;


UPDATE: Modify existing todo (changed description and status)

UPDATE todos t 
SET description='zootopia 2', status='completed'
WHERE id=2;


DELETE: Remove a todo by its ID (delete a duplicate with id 4)

DELETE FROM todos 
WHERE id=4;


DESCRIPTION OF WORK
                        

  WHAT I DID:
  1. Performed basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations:
     - Created two new todo items using INSERT statements
     - Retrieved all todos using SELECT query to verify data
     - Updated todo with id=2 (changed description and status)
     - Deleted todo with id=4 from the database
  2. Verified all operations by running SELECT queries after each modification


  ISSUES ENCOUNTERED AND SOLUTIONS
                        

  Issue 1: Syntax error 
  Problem: wrong sql query WHERE SET description='zootopia 2' AND status='completed'
  Solution: SET description='zootopia 2',  status='completed'

  Issue 2: NULL vs empty string confusion
  Problem: Initially used empty string '' for description field
           Uncertainty about when to use NULL vs ''
  Solution: Used NULL for truly absent/unknown values (no description)
           Empty string '' can be used for intentionally blank values
           For optional TEXT fields, NULL is more semantically correct

  Issue 3: No visible confirmation after INSERT
  Problem: After executing INSERT, no immediate feedback was shown
  Solution: Ran SELECT * FROM todos to verify data was actually inserted
           In DBeaver, can also refresh table view in Database Navigator
