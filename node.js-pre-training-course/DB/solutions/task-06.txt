CREATE INDEX: Add index on status column for performance optimization

CREATE INDEX index_status
ON todos (status);


SHOW INDEX: Display all indexes on todos table

SHOW INDEX
FROM todos;


EXPLAIN: Analyze query execution plan

EXPLAIN SELECT *
FROM todos t 
WHERE t.status = 'completed';


DESCRIPTION OF WORK


WHAT I DID:
1. Created an index named 'index_status' on the status column of todos table
2. Verified index creation using SHOW INDEX command
3. Analyzed query execution plan using EXPLAIN to see how MySQL uses the index
4. Compared query performance with and without index


QUERY EXPLANATIONS:

CREATE INDEX Statement:
Creates a database index on the status column [web:69][web:71]
Index name: index_status
Target: todos table, status column
Purpose: Speed up queries filtering by status (WHERE status = 'value')
Index type: B-tree (default for MySQL) which allows fast lookups

SHOW INDEX Command:
Displays all indexes defined on the todos table [web:71]
Shows information about each index including:
  Table: Name of the table (todos)
  Non_unique: Whether index allows duplicate values (1 = yes)
  Key_name: Name of the index (index_status, PRIMARY)
  Seq_in_index: Column position in the index
  Column_name: Which column is indexed (status)
  Cardinality: Estimated number of unique values
  Index_type: Type of index structure (BTREE)

EXPLAIN Statement:
Analyzes and displays the execution plan for a SELECT query [web:72][web:73]
Shows how MySQL will execute the query, including:
  id: Query identifier
  select_type: Type of SELECT (SIMPLE, SUBQUERY, etc.)
  table: Which table is being accessed (todos)
  type: Join type or access method (ref, ALL, index, etc.)
    - ALL means full table scan (slow, no index used)
    - ref means index lookup (fast, index used)
  possible_keys: Indexes that could potentially be used (index_status)
  key: Index actually chosen by optimizer (index_status or NULL)
  key_len: Length of the index key used
  ref: Columns or constants compared to the index
  rows: Estimated number of rows to examine
  Extra: Additional information (Using where, Using index, etc.)


PERFORMANCE IMPACT:

Without Index:
type: ALL (full table scan)
key: NULL (no index used)
rows: Scans all rows in table
Performance: Slow on large tables

With Index (index_status):
type: ref (index reference scan)
key: index_status (uses the index)
rows: Only examines rows matching 'completed' status
Performance: Significantly faster, especially with many rows
