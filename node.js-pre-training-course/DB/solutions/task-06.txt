CREATE INDEX: Add index on status column for performance optimization

CREATE INDEX index_status
ON todos (status);


SHOW INDEX: Display all indexes on todos table

SHOW INDEX
FROM todos;


EXPLAIN: Analyze query execution plan

EXPLAIN SELECT *
FROM todos t 
WHERE t.status = 'completed';


DESCRIPTION OF WORK
                      
WHAT I DID:
1. Created an index named 'index_status' on the status column of todos table
2. Verified index creation using SHOW INDEX command
3. Analyzed query execution plan using EXPLAIN to see how MySQL uses the index
4. Compared query performance with and without index


PERFORMANCE IMPACT:

Without Index:
type: ALL (full table scan)
key: NULL (no index used)
rows: Scans all rows in table
Performance: Slow on large tables

With Index (index_status):
type: ref (index reference scan)
key: index_status (uses the index)
rows: Only examines rows matching 'completed' status
Performance: Significantly faster, especially with many rows
