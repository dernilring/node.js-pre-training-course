DESCRIPTION OF WORK AND ISSUES ENCOUNTERED                    

  WHAT I DID:
  1. Installed MySQL 8.0.44 on Ubuntu using APT package manager
  2. Configured MySQL security settings using mysql_secure_installation
  3. Installed DBeaver CE as a graphical database management tool
  4. Created a new database named 'todo_app'
  5. Created 'todos' table with proper data types and constraints

ISSUES ENCOUNTERED AND SOLUTIONS:

  Issue 1: Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost' in DBeaver
  Problem: Root user in MySQL 8.0 uses auth_socket authentication by default,
    which doesn't work with GUI tools like DBeaver
  Solution: Created a separate admin user with password authentication:
    CREATE USER 'admin'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'secure_password';
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'admin'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;
    FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

  Issue 2: Connection refused error in DBeaver
  Problem: DBeaver was trying to connect via TCP/IP, but configuration was incorrect
  Solution: Used 127.0.0.1 instead of 'localhost' as host address

  Issue 3: Public Key Retrieval is not allowed
  Problem: MySQL 8.0 security settings block public key retrieval by default
  Solution: Enabled 'allowPublicKeyRetrieval=true' in DBeaver driver properties
